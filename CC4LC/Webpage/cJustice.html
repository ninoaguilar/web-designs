				<h3>What is Community?</h3>
			
				<p><em>"Community is a comprehensive structure. It is a social whole, a common life. It expresses not simply ones need or interest, but the full round of common needs and interests of local residents. The residents of a community live together, sharing a common life, and they also act together solving common problems and seizing opportunities for improving their common life". (Wilkinson, 1986)</em></p>
			
				<h4>Community:</h4>
					<ul class="list">
					  <li>Shared physical boundaries</li>
					  <li>Shared Experiences</li>
					  <li>Shared Interests</li>
					  <li>Shared Lives</li>
					  <li>Being Part of the Whole Community</li>
					</ul>
				
				<h3>What is Justice?</h3>
				<h4>Justice: The Need To Be Fair</h4>
				<p class="first-child">"It's not fair!" Those of us who are parents or who work with children have heard this many times. Yet, have you ever stopped to consider how a three-year-old can possibly grasp what "fair" is? Is it reasonable to say that we, the human race, have an innate need for fairness? Do we inherently know the principles behind what is fair and is there some universal rule of conduct that dictates when something is unfair?</p>
				<p>As children, we are called upon to "play fair". Shared rules of fairness helped to keep games peaceful. As long as we played by the same rules, those participating felt satisfied. The principles of justice are based on fairness. Justice ensures that people receive "fair treatment". That when people's actions conform to the rules of "fair play" - justice prevails and that if injustices occur, they are to be fairly addressed.</p>
				<p>What is the response to activities that violate society's rules of "fair play" ?</p>
				<p>Restorative Justice is based on the philosophy that crime is a violation against human relationships. Therefore, because crime hurts, justice should heal. The focus of Restorative Justice is on repairing the harm caused by the crime and seeks the involvement of the victim, the offender, and the community in the justice response.</p>
				<p>A central premise of Restorative Justice is that those directly affected by the offense should have a voice and say in the decision-making process so that a just outcome might be reached.</p>
				<p>Restorative Justice encourages victims to take an active role in determining the responsibilities and obligations of the offender; it holds offenders accountable for their wrongdoing and provides opportunities for them to pay back the victim for their loss and repair the harm; it provides competency development opportunities for offenders to learn how to make meaningful choices, understand the harm they have caused, and how to make the necessary changes to avoid harmful behavior in the future.</p>
				<p>"Restorative Justice provides us with a concrete response to the question, 'what can we do about it?'" (Lorraine Stutzman Amstutz, Director Mennonite Central Committee, Office on Crime and Justice)</p>
				<p>Consider The Golden Rule: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. This social rule is about balanced fairness. Would you not desire to be treated fairly in all circumstances of life? The concept that you should extend the same praise to others for accomplishments; consequences for wrongdoings; and fairness for how to be treated as you would like to receive yourself, counteracts the tendency for people to use different rules for themselves and for others.</p>
				<p>How can we make the world fairer? We may not have the power to change the world, but we can be part of the change and make a difference inour community. We can make small contributions on a daily basis by cultivating fairness towards others. When conflict occurs, seek to respond with the principles of restorative justice.</p>
			
			
				<p class="quote">Restorative Justice is a mechanism for achieving the goals of community justice. It is a model within the framework of community justice which emphasizes that crime is a violation of individuals, communities, and relationships and "creates obligations to make things right". (Zehr, 1990) Colorado Forum on Community & Restorative Justice</p>
